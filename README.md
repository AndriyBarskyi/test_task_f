## Test Task: Flutter Client Application

This is the client-side Flutter application for the test task. The Flutter app allows you to interact with the server-side application to store and retrieve numerical data.

### Prerequisites

Before running the Flutter client application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Flutter Installation**: Flutter must be installed on your system. You can follow the official installation guide for your operating system on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Running the Flutter Application

Follow these steps to run the Flutter client application:

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed correctly.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory of your Flutter application.

3. Run the following command to build and start the Flutter app:

   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

   This will start the Flutter app on an emulator or connected device.

### Usage

Once the Flutter app is running, you can use it to interact with [the server-side application](https://github.com/AndriyBarskyi/test_task). The app provides a simple user interface to increment a counter value and send it to the server for storage. It also allows you to retrieve the counter value from the server and display it on the app.

### Server-Side Application

This Flutter client application is designed to work with the server-side application. The server-side application should be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080` or a custom server URL. If you haven't set up the server application yet, please refer to the respective README in the server project for instructions.

**Note**: This README provides instructions for the Flutter client-side application. If you want to set up the [server-side application](https://github.com/AndriyBarskyi/test_task), please refer to the respective README in [the server project](https://github.com/AndriyBarskyi/test_task).
